title: "Simpsons Average Episode Rating"
---

My graph shows the average IMDb rating of Simpsons episodes from 2010-2016 from the Tidyverse set made on 2025-02-04 with credit to Prashant Banerjee and Kaggle for making this data available to the public.

This data is taken from a Tidy Tuesday Github repository which explores a Kaggle Simpsons dataset of 600 Simpsons episodes. Further, the Kaggle dataset rehosted the original data scrape which occurred in 2016 with credit to Todd Schneider.. A lot of hierarchy to data, I know.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig.alt: "Line plot showing the average IMDb rating of Simpsons episodes from 2010 to 2016. Ratings  decline over time, with the highest average rating occurring in the earliest years."

simpsons_episodes <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-04/simpsons_episodes.csv')

average_ratings <- simpsons_episodes %>%
  group_by(original_air_year) %>%
  summarize(average_rating = mean(imdb_rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(original_air_year >= 2010 & original_air_year <= 2016) %>%

best_year <- average_ratings %>%
  slice_max(average_rating)
